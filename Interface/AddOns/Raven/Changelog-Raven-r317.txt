Fix issue with hiding some UI elements when entering pet battles.
Add extra check to pixel perfect alignment code to fix obscure Lua error (i.e., root cause not clear but this should fix the symptom).
Generate wild mushroom buff for resto and balance druids including count and remaining time (when count > 1 for balance druids then remaining time is for longest duration wild mushroom).

Add line in tooltip showing the listed spell ids (only when alt and control keys are held down when mousing over the bar/icon) from imported spell lists such as in the Raven_Filter_Leila addon. This is a quality of life improvement for maintainers of such lists, allowing them to find listed spell ids for spells that have multiple associated spell ids. This has essentially no impact on the primary code path.
