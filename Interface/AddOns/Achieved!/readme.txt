Achieved! v0.3
==============================

Author: Tuhljin

Achieved! allows you to customize the position and scale (size) of the achievement alert frames you see when you earn
an achievement, as well as change how long those alerts remain on the screen. This is especially useful for players
who have customized their UIs in such a way that the alerts would otherwise block important elements of the
interface.

Achieved! aims to be light-weight and easy-to-use. Type /achd or /achieved in-game for instructions.
