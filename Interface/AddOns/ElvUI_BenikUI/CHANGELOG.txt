[b]1.05[/b] (May 21, 2014)

*Added an option that can show/hide the mail icon from the minimap (requires a reloadui).

[b]1.04[/b] (Apr 27, 2014)

*Changed position of the right chat buttons. "G" (Game menu) button is now on left and "C" (ElvUI config) button (aka "E") is now on the right. Also edited dropdown.lua, so that the menu position will not be related to mouse clicks. See dropmenu.lua in core folder.
*Removed the "C" button under the minimap. It's already at the bottomright chat corner. It will appear when BenikUI dataTexts are disabled.
*Added option to toggle BenikUI dataTexts transparency. Hmm.. they look nice without transparency :)
TODO: adopt BG dts

[b]1.03[/b] (Apr 21, 2014)

*Forgot to remove LootWonAlertFrame1 from skinning. Looks baaaad :P

[b]1.02[/b] (Apr 21, 2014)

*Added options to disable each of the Dashboards. Also can now be hidden while in combat.
*Added an option to apply transparency in actionbar dackdrops and actionbar buttons. My ElvUI_Transparent_AB plugin, in case is loaded, will be disabled.

*Added/changed stuff in the install routine.

*Final release.
*Fixed and cleaned many small thingies.
*Added Zygor guides in BenikUI style.
*Rearranged the options (got jealous from Blazeflack :P)

[b]0.49beta[/b] (Apr 13, 2014)

*Removed the statusbars from buffs and debuffs. Wasn't working as intended.
*Added an option to hide player text values (health, power or any customText), when mouse over to show xp or rep bars. This is done to prevent rep or xp text overlapping health or power values in case the text is wide (usually with big rep names). Each value will hide if their y offset is < -10.

[b]0.48beta[/b] (Apr 11, 2014)

*Added an option to disable BenikUI chat datatexts. In order to show, default ElvUI chat datatexts must be disabled.

[b]0.47beta[/b] (Apr 10, 2014)

*Layout fix on hide/show chat datatexts.

*Added RareCoordinator in BenikUI style. Minor changes in S&L styling.

*Fixed a lua error when the threat bar was set in left chat. Also fixed the threat bar behaviour when default ElvUI chat datatexts are enabled.
TODO: Auras status bars; ain't working as intended.



[b]0.46beta[/b] (Apr 9, 2014)

*Made BenikUI layout a seperate module.

*Different (more efficient) approach on hide/show chat datatexts.



[b]0.45beta[/b] (Apr 8, 2014)

*Fixed the detached portraits strata. They should now overlap the player and target frame.

*Fixed the xp/rep text format not changing cause were calling ElvUI's text format option. Added an option in BenikUI.

*BenikUI chat datatexts will hide when default ElvUI ones are shown. (needs a moar testing.. going to bed)

*Updated locales.

*Added the logo at the options. Probably I will remove it.. dunno yet

*Added a couple of frames not styled.



[b]0.44beta[/b] (Apr 6, 2014)

*Reworked the xp and rep on PlayerBar. This time it's perfectofinal :P

*Cleanup.



[b]0.43beta[/b] (Apr 4, 2014)

*BenikUI style in Shadow & Light edit.

*Detached Portraits at last! (Big thanks to Blazeflack).

*Added an option to make the non overlayed portraits transparent (detached or not).

*Removed the XP & Rep "Hide Text" option on the PlayerBar. Way too many checks with minimal result. Hiding the text can still be done in ElvUI General options.

*Applied a small fix for Skada style (Thanks Azilroka).

*Renamed the Mail datatext to BuiMail, so it doesn't conflict or show as duplicate, if another addon adds a similar datatext.

[b]0.42beta
[/b] (Apr 2, 2014)

*Added 3 color themes plus the default ElvUI. 'Diablo' (dark red), 'Mists' (dark green), 'Hearthstone' (dark blue). Available in BenikUI options or in the install (step 3).

*Added AtlasLoot, Altoholic styled skin.

*Changed Tooltip statusbar texture.



[b]0.41beta[/b] (Mar 29, 2014)

*Added the default options for Target detached frame.



[b]0.40beta[/b] (Mar 29, 2014)

*Tiny changes on skin styling.

*Made another attempt on Target Detached Portrait. Mirrored the player one. Something is missing. Doesn't get the target changes onload. Re-enabling it or make any changes on target it applies.. reload and go kill yourself



[b]0.39beta[/b] (Mar 28, 2014)

*Reverted to Azilroka's skin file after his latest update in AddOnSkins (v2.15). A bit more fine tuning may needed.

*Removed the font.lua file. No need to force users to use BenikUI. On it's final release, BenikUI will have a seperate addon to override ElvUI name and damage font, to fit with BenikUI. What was added in 0.37b wasn't working as intended.

*Added option for the actionbars switch buttons. The user can now choose on which bar (1 or 2) the Switch buttons will show.

*Added style in WorldMap (needs testing for taints). The style applies only on small and quest map not on the big map.

*Fixed a visibility bug when the game menu and the bags were opened.

*Fine tune the install profile.



[b]0.38beta[/b] (Mar 25, 2014)

*Done with skin styling. Not with this result without Azilroka. Big thanks :)

*Added BenikUI Style in TinyDPS skin



[b]0.37beta[/b] (Mar 23, 2014)

*Azilroka's magic touch overhauled the styling functions and the skins. Still issues to solve though.

*Added option in ElvUI options -> General -> Media -> Fonts, that will force (or not) BenikUI fonts on names and combat text. This requires a client restart to apply.
